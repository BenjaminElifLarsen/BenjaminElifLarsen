- Hi, I’m, for now, Benjamin Elif Larsen as I am transgendered, in the early phase, and not got a name changed yet.
- I’m interested in learning all sort of stuff.
- I’m currently learning domain driven design, CQRS, event sourcing, handling of events and commands via busses and handlers, sagas and a lot more. 
- Currently, in some kind of internship, which means I do not work a lot on personal code.
