- Hi, I’m, for now, Benjamin Elif Larsen as I am transgendered, in the early phase, and not got a name changed yet.
- I’m interested in learning all sort of stuff.
- I’m currently learning domain driven design, CQRS, events sourcing, handling of events and commands via busses and handlers, sagas and a lot more. 
- I am be reached using the email on my webpage https://elif-portfolio.dk/ Do note that current the webpage is only in Danish, but an English version is being worked on.
